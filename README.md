## Problem Title
Development of e-Portal for facilitating Case Management Hearing of various types of cases
## Problem Description
Case Management Hearing, known as a Pre-Trial Conference" in other jurisdictions". This application is used for managing case files since filing to disposal and to complete all its related processes. The CMS keeps the records of all the cases filed in Delhi High Court. The system has following features: Filing of Case, Caveat matching, Allocation of case, Daily Case Proceedings, Notice Generation, Case Transfer, Case Status Search, Report, etc.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Law and Justice

## Idea
Here are some ideas to enhance your E-Waste Facility Locator beyond the core functionalities:

Advanced Search & Filtering:
Allow users to filter facilities based on accepted e-waste categories (e.g., computers, TVs, batteries).

Interactive Features:
Develop a quiz or interactive map to educate users about responsible e-waste practices in a fun way. Include a "responsible disposal guide" with step-by-step instructions on data wiping and preparing e-waste for recycling.

Data & Insights:
Implement a system to track user-reported e-waste types and quantities for data analysis by the Ministry of Environment.

## Technology Stack

Technology Stack Here's a breakdown of the technology stack suitable for developing the E-Waste Facility Locator website:

Front-End:
HTML: The foundation for building the website's structure and content. CSS: Responsible for styling the website's visual elements like layout, fonts, and colors. JavaScript Framework: A framework like ReactJS can offer a more dynamic and interactive user experience. ReactJS allows you to build reusable components and manage complex data flows efficiently.

Back-End:
Database: A database like PostgreSQL is a solid choice for storing information like: E-waste facility details (location, contact information, accepted waste types) Educational content (text, images, videos) User data (if implementing the reward system) - usernames, points, etc. (ensure secure storage practices like hashing passwords) Device data (if implementing the reward system) - model numbers and corresponding precious metal content (partner with e-waste recycling companies for this data)

API Integration:
Google Maps API: This will be crucial for implementing the facility locator functionality. It allows users to search for nearby facilities, visualize locations on a map, and get directions. Optional API: If implementing the reward system, you might need to integrate with an API provided by e-waste recycling companies to access data on precious metal content in various devices.
